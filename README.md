This is an app created for CIT 261 - Mobile App Development.

The overall function of the app is to allow a user to select a car, enter the number of miles it was driven on that tank, 
and enter the number of gallons it took to fill that tank. The app will then calculate the Miles per Gallon (MPG) of the car and continue to keep track over time.

This app is created by Amy Norman and Crystal Coatney
